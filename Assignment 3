1. Write a C++ program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them. 
Sample Output:
Print the name in reverse where last name comes first: 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Input First Name: Alexandra
Input Last Name: Abramov
Name in reverse is: Abramov Alexandra

2. Write a C++ program to calculate the sum of all even and odd numbers in an array. 
Sample Output:
Original array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Sum of all even and odd numbers: 20,16

3. Write a C++ program to print the code (ASCII code / Unicode code etc.) of a given character. 
Sample Output:
Print code (ASCII code / Unicode code etc.) of a given
character: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Input a character: a
The ASCII value of a is: 97
The character for the ASCII value 97 is: a

4. Write a C++ program to enter P, T, R and calculate Simple
Interest. 
Sample Output:
Calculate the Simple Interest : 
-----------------------------------
Input the Principle: 20000
Input the Rate of Interest: 10
Input the Time: 1.5
The Simple interest for the amount 20000 for 1 years @10 %is:
2000

5. Write a C++ program to enter P, T, R and calculate compound interest. 
Sample Output:
Calculate the Compound Interest : 
-------------------------------------
Input the Principle: 20000
Input the Rate of Interest: 10
Input the Time: 1.5
The Interest after compounded for the amount 20000 for 1.5 years
@10% is: 3073.8

6. Write a C++ program to add two binary numbers. 
Sample Output:
Addition of two binary numbers: -----------------------------------
Input the 1st binary number: 1010
Input the 2nd binary number: 0011
The sum of two binary numbers is: 1101

7. Write a C++ program to find the largest element of a given array of integers. 

8. Write a C++ program to sort a given unsorted array of integers, in wave form. 
Note: An array is in wave form when 
array[0] >= array[1]<=array[2] >= array[3] <= array[4] >= . . . 

9. Write a C++ program to separate even and odd numbers in an array of integers. Put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers. 

10. Write a C++ program to find the smallest element of a given array of integers.
